# StartupML

This github post is part of a submission for Startup.ML's San Francisco fellowship. To showcase my knowledge and skill level with data science, I chose to work on the Global Terrorism Attack Attribution problem, which asks to build a model that can predict what terrorist group is responsible for attacks where the terrorist group is unknown. The decision tree grid search classification model had the highest accuracy (95%) for predicting the terrorist group of in sample test data.

The data for this challenge can be found at https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/
