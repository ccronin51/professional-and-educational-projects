# Prompt
Rideshare Company ("RC") is interested in predicting rider retention. To help explore this question, we have provided a sample dataset of a cohort of users who signed up for an RC account in January 2014. The data was pulled several months later; we consider a user retained if they were “active” (i.e. took a trip) in the preceding 30 days.

We would like you to use this data set to help understand what factors are the best predictors for retention, and offer suggestions to operationalize those insights to help RC.

See below for a detailed description of the dataset. Please include any code you wrote for the analysis and delete the data when you have finished with the challenge.

1. Perform any cleaning, exploratory analysis, and/or visualizations to use the provided data for this analysis (a few sentences/plots describing your approach will suffice). What fraction of the observed users were retained?
2. Build a predictive model to help RC determine whether or not a user will be retained. Discuss why you chose your approach, what alternatives you considered, and any concerns you have. How valid is your model? Include any key indicators of model
performance.
3. Briefly discuss how RC might leverage the insights gained from the model to
improve its rider retention (again, a few sentences will suffice).
